# Return of Serve

### Return of Serve: 
Pick a place to stand:
On return of serve we first have to pick a place to stand; so depending on how the person who is serving; if they are serving hard and deep we want to start very deep behind the baseline; if they are serving a little shorter then we start a little closer to the net; it is obviously better to start deeper and take steps forward to prepare for your shot; 

small step forward to start
when the server is preparing to serve I like to take a small little step forward I usually step with my left foot first then right and then I know I am ready; then feet shoulder width apart; and knees bent with paddle out in front; often we see people just bend at the waist and to me that is a common mistake since you may feel like you are ready but our base with on toes and knees bent is where we can react the best to get in position to the next shot; 

twist trunk & start back swing
- in many shots I like to start by twisting the trunk; basically this is the mechanics of twisting our upper body and bringing our paddle back in preparation of the shot;

Power step with outside foot
our first step in return of serve is our power step with the outside foot; we read where the ball is going to land and take a strong power step with the outside foot;
