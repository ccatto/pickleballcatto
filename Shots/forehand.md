# Pickleball Dinks 🏓

## What Is a Dink?
A **dink** is a soft, controlled shot hit from near the **non-volley zone (kitchen)** that just clears the net and lands in the opponent’s kitchen. It’s one of the most important shots in pickleball and a key part of winning at higher levels.

---

## Why Dinking Matters
- Slows the game down and limits power shots
- Forces opponents to hit up
- Creates openings for attackable balls
- Rewards patience, consistency, and control

At advanced levels, points are often won through **dink rallies**, not power.

---

## Proper Dink Technique
- **Grip:** Relaxed continental grip
- **Stance:** Slightly open, knees bent
- **Swing:** Short and compact
- **Contact point:** In front of your body
- **Motion:** Push or lift the ball gently (no wrist flick)
- **Target:** Opponent’s kitchen feet or sidelines

Think **smooth and controlled**, not fast.

---

## Common Dink Mistakes
- Hitting too hard or trying to be perfect
- Adding unnecessary wrist action
- Standing too tall or stiff
- Trying to attack too early
- Dinking cross-court without margin

---

## Cross-Court vs Straight Dinks
### Cross-Court Dinks
- Higher net clearance
- More margin for error
- Better angle control
- Preferred in most situations

### Straight-Ahead Dinks
- Faster and lower margin
- Useful for surprise or pressure
- Best used selectively

---

## When to Attack a Dink
Only attack when the ball is:
- Too high
- Sitting up
- Short with no pace
- Clearly attackable

**Rule of thumb:** If you’re not sure, don’t attack.

---

## Dink Drills
- **Kitchen to Kitchen:** Continuous soft dinks
- **Cross-Court Only:** Focus on consistency
- **Two Dinks + One Speed-Up:** Practice patience and timing
- **Target Practice:** Aim at cones or kitchen corners

---

## Key Takeaway
Dinking isn’t about winning the point immediately — it’s about **setting up the win**. Patience, touch, and discipline separate good players from great ones.

*Control the dink, control the point.*
