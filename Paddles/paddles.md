# Paddles

I have been asked about paddles from friends often and want to share some interesting paddle reviews as of Nov 2025; 

**TLDR:** All new paddles are foam core

* Most all of these new paddles are "2 FOAMS" with EVA edge ring with EPP center

## My Opinion:
* Don't spend > $250 on paddle
* It's the player not the paddle HA

This is John Kew's (a great objective paddle reviewer on YouTube & has huge database) recent top 5 paddles list - (as aside his top rated ball LT Pro 48):

## Top 5 Paddles

| Rank | John's List | Price | Eddie's List (his sidekick) | Price |
|------|-------------|-------|----------------------------|-------|
| 1 | Gearbox GX2 Power SST Core | $280 | Vatic V-Sol Pro (long handle) | $100 |
| 2 | Luzz Inferno (MPP foam) | $230 | Luzz Inferno | - |
| 3 | Selkirk Boomstick | $333 | Bread Button Loco | $200 |
| 4 | Ronbus Quanta / Vatic V-Sol Pro | $100 | Rhombus Quanta (R4) | - |
| 5 | 6.0 Black Opal | ~$230 | 6.0 Opal (top grit surface) | - |

Both of these guys like the hybrid shape. Personally I tend to lean toward elongated. I love the new idea of long handle options.

## Honorable Mentions:
* **Honolulu J6NF** ~$200
* **Thrive Fury** ~$200
* **Friday Fever 102** ~$99

Hope you liked this; I found it quite interesting. I think by spring '26 this will all change. HA
