# My Personal Paddle Journey

I strongly believe it's the player not the paddle; I have usually played with $50 unbranded paddles from China. 

## Here's my progression:

**Joola Essentials** (black)
- 1st paddle I bought $50; started here since I liked Joola from ping pong

**All Black Honeycomb Gen 2**
- Unbranded paddle, loved the all-black look

**All Black Thermoformed Honeycomb**
- Another unbranded favorite

**Joola Agassi Pro 4** (Early Spring '25)
- Played for many months; like the power of the EVA foam ring power

**CRBN Full Foam**
- Switched to this next; bigtime power

**Vatic Pro V-Sol** (long handle)
- Currently playing with this - it's outstanding! Power; control; price and look

**Honolulu J2NF** (2 foam core)
- My next paddle (unbranded) but will probably will stay with the Vatic

## Weight

In the beginning I added all kinds of weight in different spots; when I played tennis we added weight on top to add more power; but then I was developing tennis elbow so I have not been adding weight much lately;
