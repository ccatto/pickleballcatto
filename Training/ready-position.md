# Ready Position

Ready position to me is probably the most important concepts and is where we start just about every shot; 

Ready position to will slightly differ from what shot we are taking but fundamentally the same; 
When I think of my ready position this is what I like to focus on: 

Feet about shoulder length about;
On the toes 
bend the knees
paddle out in front
off hand on thought of paddle


ready position for a couple different shots: 

### At Net:
A couple difference I think is when at net I like a slightly wider stance with a deeper knee bend so we can react quicker; 

### Return of Serve: 
Feet shoulder width apart; on toes with knees bent with paddle out in front; off hand on throat often we see people just bend at the waist flat footed and to me that is a common mistake since you may feel like you are ready but our base with on toes and knees bent is where we can react quickly and the best to get in position to the next shot;

### Baseline 


### After defensive lob or opponent has high easy volley

* Keep paddle down low
