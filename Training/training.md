# Training 

This is our training page; where I want to place some training materials;

Currently I have enjoyed training for an hour about once a week with my brother and some friends early in the morning before work occasionally. We are developing a format of our training session. We currently have a few drills that we do regularly and then a set time where we have to focus on a certain area. I am going to outline what we do and the changes we make to as we refine it to see what works and where we can improve. 

Our [Standard structure](standard-schedule.md): 

Standard Schedule:
7am 5 - 10 min Warmup
Cross court day 8.15
1 Net & 1 mid court - Drop & Volley (try more backhands than forehands
1 up 1 baseline & switch
10 overheads 
5 - 10 min Volleys  (keep ball in air)
In air volleys keep in play for 10 then aggressive or something like that
Maybe then 1 player hits to feet while the other has to dig? 
7:15 - 7;40 - Focus Time - different topic area each week;
7:40: 5-10 min Serve & return of serve - (2 critical shots to improve) 
Focus on serve consistency; depth & location ( to backhand )
Return consistent & deep (maybe intentionally take more backhands)
7:48ish: 5-10 min 7-11 competitive gave situation
One person at Net other baseline & keep score
Baseline person serves and net person cannot return in kitchen; 
Net person needs to get to 11 while baseliner only needs to get to 7
