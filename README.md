Catto's Pickleball notes

This is going to be a public notes for Pickleball

I have really enjoyed playing pickle as I started in spring of 2023 and have continued ever since as of the the writing of this in Nov 2025; I wanted to publish my notes for anyone to view and also for me to access easily so I chose this github repo. 

I am thinking we have some sections so to start we will have 
* [Training](/Training/training.md)
* Paddles
* People
